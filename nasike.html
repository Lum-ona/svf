                <h3>RIGHTEOUS REBELLION</h3>
                <h2>NASIKE'S FIGHT AGAINST FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION</h2>
                <p>
                  Nasike Legupa is a 10-year-old girl from Samburu County in
                  Northern Kenya. She lost both parents when she was still a
                  little girl with the mother dying first followed by the
                  step-father a few years later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Her life has been, in her words, “a bird’s life. … you see a
                  bird doesn’t know what it will eat and probably not where it
                  will sleep on any single day and sometimes it has to perch and
                  even sleep on a thorny shrub” She means having parents or not
                  is still the same for her as she quips. Why so? Nasike’s
                  mother was mentally ill when Nasike was born. So she took no
                  care of her and her step-father on the other hand didn’t care
                  since it is not the work of Turkana men to take care of little
                  and even older children! That is women’s work! In her early
                  childhood, life was very difficult for her. She depended on
                  the goodwill of relatives and friends to survive. In the
                  circumstances, she did not even join school when she attained
                  school going age.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There was nobody to enroll her in school nor get her the mere
                  basics like school uniform, registration fees and books, let
                  alone other girl’s needs.

                <p>
                  The height of frustration came when one day, just before dawn,
                  her father came home with a group of old women and some older
                  men whose agenda was clear to her. The women were on mission
                  to carry out Female Genital Mutilation on her while one of the
                  old men in tow would immediately declare her an adult after
                  the cut and therefore, his wife! She shivered with fear and
                  trepidation. Thinking quickly, she slithered through a space
                  in the walls of her hut and vanished into the darkness never
                  to return. Her athletic legs helped her to outrun her pursuers
                  as the elders went after baying for her blood. All that
                  trailed her were shrill shouts of bloody-over thirty women and
                  men pursuing but they were no match for her. They lost and she
                  won this first battle. Later she leant that her father died.
                  Perhaps he could not bear the frustration of losing dowry
                  after Nasike escaped, and the shame of being branded a father
                  of a coward!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before this incident, Nasike had been hearing from other girls
                  that life was good, “in the big city, that had something
                  called electricity, a lot of water and fashionable things’,
                  that every girl fancied. The city they referred to is, Samburu
                  county headquarters Maralal. She had been misled to believe
                  that she could get work as a house help. She walked for days
                  through dangerous wilderness asking for directions to the city
                  and finally got to her destination without any idea where to
                  start, what to drink or eat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She had no idea that it was illegal for anyone to employ a
                  minor as that would be child-labor. So she didn’t get what
                  brought her, a job as a house help! The, “big city”, wasn’t as
                  rosy as painted by her age mates. Whereas community back in
                  the village seemed to care and she could get food and a place
                  to sleep in any household she walked into, in town life was
                  different. People were indifferent, mean and exploitative.
                  Some adults even attempted to molest her sexually and she had
                  to keep ducking them in the dark and cold streets where she
                  slept in the company of other street children.

                  For some time, she lived here but she didn’t quite get used as
                  a result of the many dangers that larked in the shadows,
                  especially attempts by fellow male children to gang rape her
                  and other girls. Together with other children, they survived
                  on begging in the streets and rummaging food waste from dust
                  bins. Luckily, small eateries owned by her tribesmen gave them
                  left over food and this helped them to survive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Help came in disguise when one day, in the wee hours of the
                  morning, the local police raided their hideout and took them
                  away, into a local recue center run by the Catholic Church
                  Sisters known as Suguta Girls Rescue Centre Centre in Samburu.
                  This became her new home where there was sanity, caring
                  Sisters (nuns), a place to sleep and food.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here she was also happy to learn abit of Kiswahili (National
                  language) through the help of the Catholic sisters. This
                  helped her be able to communicate with other people. But she
                  still, missed a family she could identify with. The Rescue
                  Center is where Shared Values Foundation team met Nasike
                  Legupae during a familiarization tour of the County. We had
                  visited the Rescue Center because the center is the run-to as
                  well as receiving center for girls running away from female
                  genital mutilation. We had visited the Rescue Center because

              The first girl we met was Nasike Legupae who came running to us
              into the warm hug of our team lead, Ms. Lucy Kathurima. The hug
              lasted what appeared like an eternity as the girl could not let go
              off the visitor. When she finally loosed her grip and looked Lucy
              in the face, her first words, heavy with yearning, were, “mom, buy
              me clothes for Christmas so that I look like other lucky girls.”
              The next staccato sentence was, “please take me to school”. She
              meant that she yearned to join a school as the Rescue Center was
              for her, ‘a sort of prison’,.

                  The Centre didn’t have a school and it was overcrowded. But
                  the nuns were surely doing what had to be done to get the
                  street and gang life out of the girls, and mentor Female
                  Genital Mutilation survivors... After Nasike regained herself
                  from what appeared like a torpor, we sat to hear her story
                  above, told between breaks of sobs and tears.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Later we spoke to many of her rescue center-mates and their
                  stories were heart rending as some had actually been
                  forcefully cut against their will and married off even before
                  healing their wounds, some were forced to consummate their
                  forced marriages while still bleeding from their fresh cuts;
                  some with young babies; while the unlucky-lucky ones were
                  banished from their homes, family and community for, “defying
                  the elders and shaming their community by their cowardly
                  acts!” After the long day of hearing depressing stories of
                  cruelty against children in the name of culture, it was time
                  to leave.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We promised Nasike that we would take her to a nice boarding
                  school with other beautiful girls , beautiful school uniform,
                  building like those of the city she dreamt of and caring
                  parents like the kind nuns who rescued her from the madness of
                  the town streets. But we made it clear that we had to get
                  permission from her current parents (meaning the nuns in
                  charge of the center) who recommended that we take her to a
                  school close to us so that we can be paying her visits. We
                  took her a school managed by the same Mary Immaculate
                  congregation. When we returned to Nairobi, SVF mobilized
                  resources and secured Nasike a place in Mary Immaculate Girls
                  Boarding school in Mweiga, Nyeri. Since she only had little
                  knowledge of Kiswahili and English acquired from Mary
                  Immaculate Rescue Centre, she could only start at grade 2
                  despite her age of 10 years, which was overage for grade 2.

                  Her joy of wearing a new uniform – the only new (not second
                  hand clothes) she had ever worn in her life and joining a new,
                  “big” school was the greatest joy of her life….

                  And SVF’s greatest joy too. Follow-up by SVF, which continues
                  to support her school fees and personal needs, shows that
                  Nasike settled down very fast and is a well behaved girl
                  having received love and acceptance from a school she calls
                  home. What isn’t more, she is doing well in school.

                  She aspires to perform well in school, advance her studies and
                  become a lawyer. Your guess is as good as ours why she wants
                  to be a lawyer. From then on, Nasike Legupae has become SVF’s
                  symbol of our determination to fight the FGM scourge and to
                  lend a hand to victims of this retrogressive cultural practice
                  and other girls in difficult circumstances like Nasike
                  Legupae.

                  Other girls left at Suguta Girls Rescue Centre Center are also
                  equally in our mind as SVF and we mobilize resources to
                  support as many as we can as they also need clothing, food,
                  fees and personal effects and parental love. Remember, almost
                  all of them are neglected by their families for defying
                  parents, community and cultural requirement to be, “made women
                  and good wives”, through the cut. Join us to support Nasike
                  Legupae and other Mary Rescue Center and out in other 21 FGM
                  hot spots in Kenya where girls and women are faced with the
                  threat of Female Genital Mutilation.
